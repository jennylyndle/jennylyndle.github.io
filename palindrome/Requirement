PROGRAMMING ASSIGNMENT
======================
Write a program that reads a text file and outputs the palindromes that occur in the file as well as the number of
occurrences for each palindrome.  The output should be in order of the most frequent palindrome to the least frequent
palindrome.  Palindromes that occur the same number of times should be ordered in lexicographic order.
A palindrome is any word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward or forward.

Examples of palindromes: 121, radar, aa

Note that for the purposes of this assignment there is no difference between uppercase and lowercase, punctuation and
special characters should be treated like word separators.

Sample input file:
A cat sat on the mat and did not peep for a single moment.  Momâ€™s phone rang and I ran to the door but Beeb went the
radar at 101 miles an hour.

Output:
a > 2
101 > 1
beeb > 1
did > 1
i > 1
mom > 1
peep > 1
radar > 1
s > 1
...

INSTRUCTIONS
============
1. Use any programming language to implement the solution.
2. Submit a zip file with the program/script and instructions on how to run it
