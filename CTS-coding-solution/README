Requirements:
-->When any parent is checked the other parents and corresponding child should be disabled and other children should be checked.
--> un checking of parent reverts things to original state.

Assumptions:
-->input is json array with non duplicated names for parent and children.
-->Each object has only one key value pair.
-->No event bound for state change in the children checkboxes
-->If a child is selected when the corresponding parent is selected thereby rendering the child disabled, it still remains checked. Eg. if
child3 is selected when i select parent3, it retains its checked state even if it is disabled.

Sample input hardcoded in script: 
-->var obj = [
	{
		parent1: 'child1'
	},{
		parent2: 'child2'
	},{
		parent3: 'child3'
	},
	{
		parent4: 'child4'
	},{
		parent5: 'child5'
	},{
		parent6: 'child6'
	},
	{
		parent7: 'child7'
	},{
		parent8: 'child8'
	},{
		parent9: 'child9'
	}
	];
